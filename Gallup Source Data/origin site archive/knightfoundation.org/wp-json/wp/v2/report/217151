With each passing benchmark study, the American people render deeper and increasingly polarized judgments about the news media and how well it is fulfilling its role in our democracy.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<p>In 2018, Gallup and Knight Foundation published the inaugural American Views report as part of their Trust, Media and Democracy research program. This landmark study of Americans\u2019 attitudes toward the news media and its role in our democracy is part of the ongoing Gallup\/Knight research effort. The 2018 report found that while Americans valued the role of the news media as an important institution in a free society, they did not believe it was fulfilling its democratic roles well. Political party was the primary determining factor driving Americans\u2019 opinions of and trust in the media.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<p>For the 2020 American Views survey, Gallup and Knight polled more than 20,000 U.S. adults and found deepening pessimism and further partisan entrenchment about how the news media delivers on its democratic mandate for factual, trustworthy information. Many Americans feel the media\u2019s critical role of informing and holding those in power accountable is compromised by increasing bias. As such, Americans have not only lost confidence in the ideal of an objective media, they believe news organizations actively support the partisan divide. At the same time, Americans have not lost sight of the value of news \u2014 strong majorities uphold the ideal that the news media is fundamental to a healthy democracy.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<p>Gallup and Knight publish these sobering findings at a moment when America\u2019s media landscape is increasingly shaped by the financial exigencies of the attention economy \u2014 and when journalism, like other democratic institutions, is growing more vulnerable to polarization and eroding trust.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<p>As evidenced in this study, party affiliation remains the key predictor of attitudes about<br>the news media. Republicans express more negative sentiments on every aspect of media performance compared to Democrats and independents. Attitudes also differ by age \u2014 likely a reflection, in part, of generational differences in news consumption, as this study documents a concerning negative trend in young Americans\u2019 opinions of the news media.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<p>This report is based on data collected between Nov. 8, 2019, and Feb. 16, 2020, just before the novel coronavirus became a global pandemic and the burgeoning movement for racial justice swept the nation. The low levels of public trust in the nation\u2019s polarized media environment have left open the possibility for dangerous false narratives to take root in all segments of society during these emergent crises. At a time when factual, trustworthy information is especially critical to public health and the future of our democracy, the striking trends documented in these pages are cause for concern. American Views offers new insights into how the public is responding to these challenges in their own media consumption and their thoughts about how to address them.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/knightfoundation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/American-Views-2020-Trust-Media-and-Democracy.pdf\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3334\" height=\"1750\" src=\"https:\/\/knightfoundation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/American-Views-2020-.jpg?w=3334\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-217368\" srcset=\"https:\/\/knightfoundation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/American-Views-2020-.jpg 3334w, https:\/\/knightfoundation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/American-Views-2020-.jpg?resize=768,403 768w, https:\/\/knightfoundation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/American-Views-2020-.jpg?resize=1536,806 1536w, https:\/\/knightfoundation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/American-Views-2020-.jpg?resize=2048,1075 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3334px) 100vw, 3334px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<h2>Executive Summary<\/h2>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<h4>1. <strong>Americans still value the media\u2019s traditional roles in society, such as providing accurate news and holding powerful interests accountable for their actions.<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<ul><li>The vast majority of Americans (84%) say that, in general, the news media is \u201ccritical\u201d (49%) or \u201cvery important\u201d (35%) to democracy.<\/li><li>Americans are more likely today to say the media\u2019s role in democracy is \u201ccritical,\u201d up five percentage points since 2017.<\/li><li>Large majorities say it is \u201ccritical\u201d or \u201cvery important\u201d for the news media to provide accurate and fair news reports (92%), ensure Americans are informed about public affairs (91%) and hold leaders accountable for their actions (85%).<\/li><li>More Americans say the media is performing poorly rather than well in accomplishing these goals than did in 2017.<\/li><\/ul>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<h4>2. <strong>However, Americans see increasing levels of bias in the news media; majorities see bias in the news source they rely on most.<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<ul><li>A majority of Americans currently see \u201ca great deal\u201d (49%) or \u201ca fair amount\u201d (37%) of political bias in news coverage. The percentage seeing a great deal of bias is up from 45% in 2017.<\/li><li>Most Americans see bias in their go-to news source; 20% see \u201ca great deal\u201d and another 36% see \u201ca fair amount\u201d of bias in the news source they rely on most often.<\/li><li>Given the choice, however, more Americans say they are concerned about bias in the news other people are getting (69%) than say they worry about their own news being biased (29%).<\/li><li>Nearly three-quarters of Americans say they see too much bias in the reporting of news that is supposed to be objective as \u201ca major problem\u201d (73%), up from 65% in the 2017 study.<\/li><\/ul>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<h4>3. <strong>Americans suspect inaccuracies in reporting are designed to push a specific agenda<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<ul><li>Americans perceive inaccurate news to be intentional \u2014 either because the reporter is misrepresenting the facts (54%) or making them up entirely (28%).<\/li><li>Nearly 8 in 10 Americans (79%) say news organizations they distrust are trying to persuade people to adopt a certain viewpoint, while 12% say they are trying to report the news accurately and fairly but are unable to do so.<\/li><li>Eight percent of Americans say distrusted media are trying to ruin the country, driven largely by the 1 in 5 Americans who identify as \u201cvery conservative\u201d and 1 in 10 Republicans who feel this way.<\/li><\/ul>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<h4>4. <strong>Differences in Americans\u2019 opinions of the news media are most pronounced by political party affiliation.<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<ul><li>Almost three-fourths of Republicans (71%) have a \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d unfavorable opinion of the news media, compared to 22% of Democrats and 52% of independents.<\/li><li>Democrats and Republicans differ greatly in their ratings of the media on every aspect of performance, including providing objective news reports, holding political and business leaders accountable for their actions and helping Americans stay informed about current affairs.<\/li><li>Sixty-nine percent of Americans, including 61% of Democrats, say the increasing number of news sources reporting from a particular point of view is \u201ca major problem.\u201d In contrast, 77% of Republicans say the same.<\/li><li>While a majority of Americans across the political spectrum (80%) say the media is under attack politically, they are divided as to whether those attacks are merited. Whereas 70% of Democrats say the media is under attack and those attacks are not justified, 61% of Republicans say such attacks are justified.<\/li><li>In addition to partisan differences in media attitudes, views also vary by age, with older Americans generally more favorable toward the news media than younger Americans. Whereas 44% of Americans aged 65 and older have \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favorable views of the media, less than 1 in 5 Americans under age 30 (19%) say the same.<\/li><\/ul>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<h4>5. <strong>Majorities of Americans say news organizations should diversify their reporting staffs, but they differ \u2014 largely by politics \u2014 on the focus of diversity efforts.<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<ul><li>A strong majority of Americans (79%) say news organizations should hire to increase the diversity of their reporting staffs. However, while majorities say it is important for the news media to reflect the diversity of America, this ranks lowest of the priorities among the roles for media to play in society.<\/li><li>The priorities cited by Americans who say news organizations should hire for more diversity differ greatly by race and political party. Democrats (49%) and Blacks (60%) prioritize racial\/ethnic diversity in hiring, while Republicans (51%) and whites (35%) are most apt to prioritize diversity in political views.<\/li><\/ul>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<h4>6. <strong>Americans commonly feel overwhelmed by the volume and speed of news, but say misinformation online is media\u2019s greatest problem.

In 2017, 58% said it was harder to be informed.<\/li><li>Reasons Americans who say it is harder to stay informed cite for feeling overwhelmed include the mix of news interspersed with non-news on the web (72%), followed by the pace or speed of news reporting (63%) and the increased number of organizations reporting the news (63%).<\/li><li>More Americans (54%) say there are enough media sources to sort out the facts than say there is so much bias it\u2019s difficult to sort out the facts (43%), an improvement from 2017 when the split was 50% to 47%, respectively. Republicans (65%) are much more likely than independents (48%) and Democrats (21%) to say there is too much bias to sort out the facts.<\/li><li>In response to feeling overwhelmed, 41% of Americans say they only pay attention to one or two trusted sources; 31% try to consult a variety of sources to see where they agree; 17% go to the extreme of ceasing to pay attention to news altogether; and 8% rely on others to help them sort out what they need to know.<\/li><\/ul>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<h4>7. <strong>Local news plays a key role in political and civic engagement.<\/strong><\/h4>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<ul><li>Thirty-one percent of Americans say they follow news about issues affecting their local community \u201cvery closely,\u201d an increase from 25% in 2017. However, most Americans are not very confident in their knowledge relating to public affairs in their community.<\/li><li>Americans who follow local news closely are more likely to vote in local elections and to feel attached to their communities. They are less likely to say that \u201cpeople like me don\u2019t have any say in what the government does.\u201d<\/li><li>Americans who primarily access their news online \u2014 predominantly, younger Americans \u2014 are less likely to be knowledgeable about their local communities and to feel attached to their communities.<\/li><\/ul>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\"rich-text\">\n<h4>8. <strong>In a deeply divided nation, majorities of Americans say the media bears blame for political division.
